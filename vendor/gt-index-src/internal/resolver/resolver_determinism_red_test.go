// RED witness for the producer nondeterminism defect: the class-method index
// behind self.method()/impl_method resolution was built by ranging over
// nodeMeta[0] (a map) with last-write-wins on (class, name). A class holding
// TWO same-named members (@overload, conditional redefinition, decorator pair)
// made the surviving index entry run-dependent, so identical trees produced
// different CALLS targets across builds. The fix keeps the lowest
// (start_line, id) — a content rule stable across runs.
//
// The same-file strategy cannot fire here: `self.dup` is qualified, and the
// ambiguous local-candidate branch only applies to unqualified calls, so
// resolution must reach Strategy 1.75 and read methodsByClass.
