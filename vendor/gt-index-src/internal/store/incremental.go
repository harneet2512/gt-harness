//   - Step 5 (spec): edges are deleted by source_file = ? OR target_id IN
//     (SELECT id FROM nodes WHERE file_path = ?). The schema has no
//     target_file column; targeting flows through target_id → nodes.id.
//     This delete MUST run BEFORE the node delete (the subquery needs the

//   - Step 6: nodes deleted by file_path = ?.
//   - The orphan-edge invariant (edges referencing missing nodes) MUST hold
//     after this operation. Verified by:
//     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM edges
