// Go. One node type, `type_declaration`, carries struct, interface and alias
// declarations, so the kind is refined from the node the grammar nests inside
// it. GT already promotes the interface case to its own label; the taxonomy
// adds the struct/alias distinction without touching any label.
//
// Go has no `implements` clause — conformance is structural and decided by the
// type checker, not the grammar — so IMPLEMENTS is declared unavailable here
// rather than guessed from an embedded type name.
